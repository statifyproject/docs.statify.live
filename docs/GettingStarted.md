# Getting Started

## Header

Welcome to the Statify docs! Statify is fairly easy to use, so theres not much to cover.

Currently Statify can grab stats for the following services:

- Discord
- Roblox
- Steam
- Twitch
- Twitter
- YouTube

Making requests is fairly simple, all you have to do is make a get request to the Statify endpoint.

Each endpoint is easy to reach. For example, if you want to get stats for youtube, the URL would be `https://api.statify.live/youtube/UsernameHere`\

A simple JSON is returned, with all the data that endpoint provides, as well as an http code.
