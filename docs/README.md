# Getting Started

Welcome to the Statify docs! Statify is fairly easy to use, so there's not much to cover.

Currently Statify can grab stats for the following services:

-   [Discord](/endpoints/discord.md)
-   [Roblox](/endpoints/roblox.md)
-   [Steam](/endpoints/steam.md)
-   [Twitch](/endpoints/twitch.md)
-   [Twitter](/endpoints/twitter.md)
-   [YouTube](/endpoints/youtube.md)

Making requests is fairly simple, all you have to do is make a get request to the Statify endpoint.

Each endpoint is easy to reach. For example, if you want to get stats for [YouTube](/endpoints/youtube.md), the URL would be `https://api.statify.live/youtube/UsernameHere`

A simple JSON is returned, with all the data that endpoint provides, as well as an http code.
